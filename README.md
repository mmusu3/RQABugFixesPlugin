# RQA Bug Fixes

This is a plugin for [Torch](https://torchapi.com/) that contains several code patches that fix various bugs within Space Engineers. These include:  
* Fix suspension wheels locking up after moving between physics clusters. Most noticable with short wheel suspensions.
* Fix the parked state of a grid not always being correct when first loading in.
* Fix battery blocks draining too much charge after being unconcealed when using the Torch Concealment plugin.
